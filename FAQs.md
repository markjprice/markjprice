# Questions about book content

I can answer questions about the content of my books because I am the author.

## Is there a roadmap that shows what order to learn .NET technologies?

Some decent .NET road maps include: 
- https://github.com/milanm/DotNet-Developer-Roadmap
- https://roadmap.sh/aspnet-core
- https://github.com/MoienTajik/AspNetCore-Developer-Roadmap/blob/master/aspnetcore-developer-roadmap.png

## What order should I read your books?

I have written articles to answer this here: 
- [What order should I read your .NET 10 books?](articles/book-sequence-net10.md)
- [What order should I read your .NET 8 and .NET 9 books?](articles/book-sequence.md)

## What's New in your .NET 10 books?

I have written an article about this here: [What's New in your .NET 10 books?](articles/whats-new-in-net10-books.md).

## Will there be editions of your books for future versions of .NET?

I have updated my C# and .NET fundamentals book and created a new book for web development that both cover .NET 9, but I will not be updating my *Apps and Services* or *Tools and Skills* books for .NET 9. Until the end of 2025, the most up-to-date editions of my .NET books are shown in the following figure:

![Quartet of .NET 8 and .NET 9 books](assets/quartet-net9.png)

Starting in November 2025, my plan* is that all four .NET books will be updated for .NET 10, as shown in the following figure and described in the numbered bullets:

![Quartet of .NET 10 books](assets/quartet-net10.png)

1.	The first book covers the fundamentals of the C# language, the .NET libraries, and modern ASP.NET Core technologies for web development. It is designed to be read linearly because skills and knowledge from earlier chapters build up and are needed to understand later chapters.
2.	The second book covers mature and proven web development technologies like ASP.NET Core MVC and controller-based Web API web services, as well as OData, FastEndpoints, and Umbraco CMS for building real-world web projects on .NET 10. You will learn how to test your web services using xUnit and test the user interfaces of your websites using Playwright, and then how to containerize your projects ready for deployment.
3.	The third book covers how to build graphical user interfaces for websites, desktop, and mobile apps with Blazor, Avalonia, and .NET MAUI respectively. Then you will learn more specialized library topics like internationalization and popular third-party packages including Serilog and NodaTime. You will learn how to build native AOT-compiled services with ASP.NET Core Minimal API and how to improve performance, scalability, and reliability using caching, queues, and background services. You will implement more services using GraphQL, gRPC, and SignalR, as well as learn how to integrate LLMs to add intelligence to your solutions. 
4.	The fourth book covers important tools and skills for a professional .NET developer. These include design patterns and solution architecture, debugging, memory analysis, all the important types of testing whether unit, performance, or web and mobile, and then containerization for deployment topics like Docker and Aspire. Finally, the book looks at how to prepare for an interview to get the .NET developer career that you want.

*Plan not guaranteed!

## Are there slide decks for your books for educational use?

No, I have not created slide decks to match the content of my books. I have had only three requests for slide decks from teachers over the past ten years so that they can more easily use my books in their courses so there isn't enough demand to make it worthwhile. But if any teachers want to contact me to discuss what a slide deck would need to look like to be useful to them, then please contact me (markjprice@gmail.com) and we can arrange a video call to discuss details and perhaps I will do something for the .NET 10 edition.

## How can a .NET developer study AI?

In the Discord channel for *Tools and Skills for .NET 8*, **CarlosBazanH** / `_carlosbazan` asked, "Hi Mark, could you recommend how a .Net developer can study AI? Where can we start? Tools, skills, etc., using .Net as the backbone."

I have written an article about this here: [How can a .NET developer study AI?](articles/dotnet-and-ai.md).

## Which IDE and OS are most popular for .NET developers?

I have written an article about this here: [IDE and OS Usage Among .NET Developers (2023–2025)](articles/ide.md).

## What do recent surveys about .NET tell us?

I have written an article about this here: [What do recent surveys about .NET tell us?](articles/surveys.md).

# Questions about book distribution and pricing

If you purchased a book from a retailer like Amazon and have an issue with that purchase then contact the retailer.

For questions about book pricing, distribution, and so on, please contact the publisher, Packt, at the following email address: customercare@packt.com

## The roles and responsibilities for publishing a book

I am surprised when readers contact me about issues that I have no control over. Here's a summary of the main roles involved with publishing a book so that you can direct your emails appropriately:

- **Author**: The author is the creator of the book’s content and often the driving force behind its vision. I also try to support my readers through the GitHub repository issues page and the Discord channel for each book. I prioritize answering public posts above private emails because public posts benefit all my readers.
- **Publisher**: The publisher manages the production, financing, and overall project direction for the book. The publisher handles editing, cover design, distribution, and marketing. The publisher owns the copyright (intellectual property) and handles legal matters. The publisher coordinates with distributors and retailers, and sets pricing, discount rates, and release schedules. You can contact my publisher at: customercare@packt.com
- **Retailer**: The retailer is where readers actually buy the book, either physically or digitally. The retailer follows publisher pricing guidelines but can adjust prices, especially online. Mega retailers like Amazon have more control over the price you pay than the publisher. 

## How to get a Packt book you have purchased as a PDF

You have two options to get a Packt book in PDF format:

1. If you purchase any other format of the book from anywhere else then you can get the PDF edition by completing a form on Packt's website with proof of purchase: https://www.packtpub.com/page/free-ebook. For example, you might buy the paperback from your local independent bookstore, or you might buy the Kindle edition from Amazon.

2. If you purchase an ebook from Packt's website then you get it in PDF and EPUB formats as well as their online reader. 

My .NET 9 books on Packt's website:
- [C# 13 and .NET 9 – Modern Cross-Platform Development Fundamentals](https://www.packtpub.com/en-us/product/c-13-and-net-9-modern-cross-platform-development-fundamentals-9781835881224)
- [Real-World Web Development with .NET 9](https://www.packtpub.com/en-us/product/real-world-web-development-with-net-9-9781835880395)

My .NET 8 books on Packt's website:
- [C# 12 and .NET 8 – Modern Cross-Platform Development Fundamentals](https://www.packtpub.com/en-us/product/c-12-and-net-8-modern-cross-platform-development-fundamentals-9781837635870)
- [Apps and Services with .NET 8](https://www.packtpub.com/en-us/product/apps-and-services-with-net-8-9781837637133)
- [Tools and Skills for .NET 8](https://www.packtpub.com/en-us/product/tools-and-skills-for-net-8-9781837635207)

## Will I be able to download a newer copy or will I have to pay anything for the newer edition?

Readers must pay for individual new editions. Some publishers offer subscription services to get access to new editions. For example, Packt Subscription: https://www.packtpub.com/subscribe

## Where can I buy your books in my country? When will a book be published in my country?

Similar questions:

- Only the Kindle edition is available to purchase from Amazon in my country. When will the paperback be published?

The publisher, Packt, handles distribution deals around the world. I live in the UK and I have no experience with buying books in your country but you probably do. Where have you bought books before in your country? Most bookstores will order a book for you if they do not have it in stock. If they cannot, then please ask the publisher, Packt, where you can buy Packt books in your country and when a book will be published there: customercare@packt.com. 

When a book is published, it often takes several days or even weeks before it is available in all formats in all countries. Usually you can order a book in both Kindle and paperback on the date of publishing from Amazon USA. Other countries will typically allow Kindle orders on the same day, but paperback orders may take longer. Regardless, as the author I have no insight into specifics. Please contact the publisher Packt and ask them: customercare@packt.com. 

## Can you give me a free copy of your book? Can you give me permission to read an illegal copy of your book?

I often get questions from readers that are actually about the intellectual property ownership of the books that I author:

- Can you give me a free copy of your book? 
- Can you give me permission to read an illegal copy of your book?
- Can I promote your book via an affiliate program?
- Can I create a YouTube channel using your book as reference?

Some readers think that because my name is on the front cover, that means the books that I author are "mine". When an author uses a phrase like "my book", what they most commonly mean is "books that I author", not "books that I own the intellectual property for". 

Inside each book cover you will see who actually owns the book. For example, for my tenth edition: **Copyright &copy; 2025 Packt Publishing**, as shown in the figure below: 

![Copyright (C) 2025 Packt Publishing](assets/copyright.png)

Authors who work with publishers just write the content. Authors are not involved in pricing and distribution, and they certainly cannot give the books away for free, or give you permission to read the books without paying for them. Authors also cannot give you permission to create new works based on Packt's books (intellectual property) or join a revenue sharing scheme or affiliate program.
