# Data Sources and Scope

To compile an up-to-date picture of .NET developers’ environments (mid-2023 to mid-2025), we draw on several surveys and community reports: JetBrains’ annual Developer Ecosystem surveys (with a focus on C#/.NET data), Stack Overflow’s global developer surveys (for broader context), an Uno Platform community survey of .NET developers, and informal polls on social platforms (LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Reddit). These sources span professional developers as well as hobbyists, students, and open-source contributors. Below we summarize key findings on operating system preferences and IDE/editor usage among .NET developers, citing specific surveys and data. (When general developer surveys are cited, we note that their scope is all developers, not just .NET specialists.)

# Operating Systems Used for .NET Development

**Windows remains the dominant OS for .NET development**, reflecting .NET’s strong Windows roots. In [JetBrains’ 2023 survey of C# developers](https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2023/11/30/the-developer-ecosystem-in-2023-key-trends-for-csharp/), 79% reported using Windows as their development environment. macOS and Linux are also significant platforms for .NET devs, albeit for a minority: 32% use macOS and 19% use Linux. (These percentages sum over 100% because some developers use multiple OS environments, e.g. a Windows PC with WSL2 or a separate Linux/Mac machine, a pattern noted as common in modern containerized and cross-platform workflows.)

* **Professionals vs. Hobbyists:** Windows is prevalent across the board, but the availability of cross-platform .NET (Core/.NET 5+) has enabled many non-Windows enthusiasts to code in C# on Mac/Linux. It’s not uncommon for enterprise developers to do primary work on Windows while testing in Linux containers, whereas hobbyist or open-source .NET developers might choose macOS or Linux as their main OS. The JetBrains data above shows a sizeable chunk on macOS, likely representing developers building .NET apps on Mac (e.g. using Xamarin/.NET MAUI or Unity on Mac) or those who prefer Unix-like environments but target .NET Core.

* **Trends:** Compared to the broader developer population, .NET devs skew more towards Windows. For context, the 2024 Stack Overflow survey (all languages) found about **47–48% of professional developers primarily work on Windows, \~32% on macOS, and \~28% on Ubuntu Linux** (with other distros in smaller proportions). [Windows was the single most popular OS among developers globally](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20primary%20operating,system%20in%20which%20you%20work), but its share is higher among .NET developers (nearly 80% using it) due to .NET’s legacy. Interestingly, **multiple OS use is common** – the JetBrains 2021 report noted [**61% of .NET devs used Windows, and Linux actually overtook macOS for #2 with 47% using Linux vs. 44% for macOS**](https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2021/08/12/the-net-ecosystem-in-2021-over-half-of-net-devs-use-c-8-46-do-not-use-diagnostic-tools-and-other-facts/#:~:text=File%20the%20next%20set%20of,usage) (multi-select). By 2023, macOS edged ahead in their survey (32% vs 19% Linux), but both non-Windows platforms have a presence. The key point is that while **Windows is still the primary development OS for most .NET engineers, a significant minority (roughly one-third) use macOS, and around one-fifth use Linux** as part of their .NET development environment. This includes professionals running cross-platform web/cloud workloads and students or OSS contributors on personal Macs/Linux machines.

# IDE and Editor Popularity in .NET Development

When it comes to development environments (IDEs and code editors), .NET developers today have three main choices: **Microsoft Visual Studio**, **JetBrains Rider**, and **Visual Studio Code**, along with a long tail of others. Surveys consistently show that **Visual Studio** (the full-featured IDE) remains the most widely used for .NET development, especially on Windows, while Rider has gained a strong following (particularly among cross-platform devs), and VS Code is used by a smaller portion for .NET work than it is in the general programming community.

## Visual Studio (IDE) – Dominant on Windows

**Microsoft Visual Studio** (Community, Professional, or Enterprise) continues to be the primary IDE for the majority of .NET developers, especially professionals on Windows. In [JetBrains’ 2023 C# survey, Visual Studio was **the most popular IDE overall**](https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2023/11/30/the-developer-ecosystem-in-2023-key-trends-for-csharp/#:~:text=IDEs%2C%20Editors%2C%20and%20Plugins). By inference, well over half of .NET developers primarily use Visual Studio. (JetBrains reported 32% use Rider and 14% use VS Code, leaving roughly \~54% to Visual Studio, which aligns with VS being the majority choice.) A [community survey by Uno Platform in late 2022](https://platform.uno/blog/net-and-windows-community-from-our-2022-survey/) likewise found **80% of .NET/Windows developers picked Visual Studio as their most important IDE**. And in an [informal 2022 social media poll (\~3,500 votes on LinkedIn and Twitter)](https://davecallan.com/poll-results-what-ide-do-net-developers-use-mostly/), Visual Studio received **“a lot more” votes than Rider**, confirming that VS is used far more widely than its competitors among .NET devs.

Several factors contribute to Visual Studio’s prevalence:

* **Windows-Only Feature Set:** Visual Studio is a first-party IDE with deep integration into the Windows/.NET ecosystem (designers for WinForms/WPF, etc.), and for a long time it was the only full IDE for .NET. Even as alternatives emerged, many developers stick with the familiar tool. As one developer quipped, *“Without Visual Studio, there would be no ReSharper… and no Rider”*, highlighting Visual Studio’s central role in the .NET tooling universe.

* **Availability and Licensing:** Visual Studio’s **Community edition is free** for individual use, and many organizations have volume licenses for Professional/Enterprise. This lowers the barrier for students and hobbyists to adopt VS, and many companies standardize on it (it’s included in MSDN subscriptions, etc.). Dave Callan, who ran the poll above, noted that VS’s free or already-licensed status likely boosts its usage compared to Rider.

* **Evolution and Improvements:** Microsoft has steadily improved Visual Studio (especially VS 2022) in performance and features, narrowing the gap with competitor tools. Some developers comment that VS’s refactoring and IDE capabilities have gotten better in recent releases, reducing the “need to switch to Rider” that existed a few years ago. In JetBrains’ data, many Visual Studio users augment it with plugins, notably **ReSharper** (JetBrains’ refactoring and analysis extension for VS) is used by 32% of Visual Studio users. This indicates a significant subset invest in enhancing VS rather than leaving it. (Visual Studio plus ReSharper is a common combo for enterprise C# developers.)

* **Platform Lock-in:** Visual Studio (Windows) naturally has near-100% adoption on Windows-only development teams (it’s the default IDE installed with .NET SDK on Windows). On **Windows OS, Visual Studio is by far the dominant IDE** for .NET. Other tools exist on Windows (Rider, VS Code), but the weight of habit and corporate support keeps VS in front for many. Visual Studio **for Mac**, however, never achieved parity with the Windows version and had a relatively small user base (\~2% of .NET devs in 2021 used VS for Mac). Microsoft announced in 2023 that **Visual Studio for Mac is being retired**, effectively ending official VS support on macOS. Most Mac-based .NET developers have thus **moved to other editors/IDEs (predominantly Rider) after VS Mac’s discontinuation**.

In summary, **Visual Studio (primarily on Windows)** remains the workhorse IDE for .NET developers. It’s the default choice for many professionals, aided by its free availability and long history. Even as competition grows, more than half of .NET devs stick with Visual Studio as their main IDE. (Notably, the Stack Overflow 2024 survey (across all devs) shows Visual Studio used by \~30% of respondents, which largely corresponds to the .NET/C++ developer segment in the wider ecosystem. We emphasize this SO figure is *not .NET-specific*, but it underlines that VS usage in the general dev world is significant but far behind VS Code, whereas in the .NET world, Visual Studio is #1.)

## JetBrains Rider is a growing cross-platform favorite

**JetBrains Rider** has established itself as a popular alternative IDE in the .NET community, especially for those working cross-platform or seeking a different experience than Visual Studio. Rider is a commercial IDE by JetBrains (built on IntelliJ platform + ReSharper), available on **Windows, macOS, and Linux**, making it attractive for .NET developers on non-Windows systems and those who prefer JetBrains’ tooling.

* **Usage Share:** Rider’s usage among .NET devs has grown in recent years. In JetBrains’ 2023 survey, **32% of C# developers reported using JetBrains Rider as their primary IDE**. This is a substantial increase from a few years prior (for example, in 2021 JetBrains found \~27% Rider usage vs 62% for VS). By 2023, Rider claims roughly one-third of the .NET IDE market in that survey. For context, Rider’s penetration is far higher in the .NET niche than in the overall developer population. Stack Overflow’s 2023–2024 surveys show only \~5–6% of *all* developers use Rider. This implies that Rider’s user base is primarily .NET developers, and among that group it’s quite influential (a **significant minority of .NET devs, second only to Visual Studio** in usage).

* **Platform Distribution:** Rider is particularly beloved on macOS and Linux, where Microsoft’s own full IDE options were lacking. Mac users often adopted Rider because, [as one Redditor noted, *“Microsoft gave up on Macs… thank goodness Rider exists”*](https://www.reddit.com/r/dotnet/comments/1cwnvak/visual_studio_vs_rider/). Dave Callan similarly observed that **Rider is “particularly popular on Mac”** since Visual Studio for Mac was “undercooked” compared to the Windows IDE. With VS Mac now discontinued, Rider has essentially become *the* full-fledged C# IDE on macOS. Many former VS for Mac users have transitioned to Rider. On Linux too, Rider fills the void of a rich .NET IDE (beyond editors like VS Code). In Windows environments, Rider also has users (some prefer its performance or features over VS, especially for large solutions or cross-platform Unity projects), but it competes directly with Visual Studio there. Overall, Rider’s cross-platform support has been a key to its adoption: one LinkedIn user noted the appeal of using “the same IDE on a Mac and Windows” for .NET development.

* **Use Cases and Community:** Rider has made particular inroads in certain domains: **game development** and **enterprise cross-platform teams**. JetBrains reports that [Rider is a “top choice” among game developers (Unity, Unreal, Godot) using .NET/C#](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2023/csharp/), in part due to Unity integration and faster handling of large projects. Many .NET open-source contributors and indie developers also favor Rider for its strong code analysis and refactoring (inherited from ReSharper) and its consistency across OSes. Notably, *developers who use Rider tend to love it*. It was ranked among the top 3 “most loved” developer tools in a Stack Overflow survey (meaning a high percentage of those who have tried Rider want to keep using it). This passionate user base advocates for Rider despite its smaller market share than VS.

* **Licensing Changes for Non-Commercial Use:** Initially, Rider required a paid license (free trials or free licenses were only available for certain groups like students or OSS maintainers). This sometimes limited its usage in hobby or student circles compared to free Visual Studio or VS Code. However, a **major recent change** is that **JetBrains made Rider free for non-commercial use in late 2024**. This move is “pretty huge” for the .NET ecosystem, as one developer noted, because it lowers the barrier for hobbyists and learners to adopt Rider (JetBrains’ intent is likely to get more people using it and then advocate for it at work). Even before this, JetBrains provided **free Rider licenses to students, teachers, and open-source project maintainers**, which helped Rider gain traction among those groups. Now that Rider is free for any non-commercial use, we may see its usage share increase further among independent developers, open-source contributors, and small startups through 2025. This change addresses one of the prior adoption hurdles (cost), while Visual Studio has long been free for individual use, so it levels that playing field.

In summary, **JetBrains Rider has about one-third of .NET developers on board, making it the #2 IDE for .NET.** Its strength is in cross-platform scenarios, virtually becoming the default for .NET on Mac/Linux, and among developers who prefer JetBrains’ tooling ecosystem. With its newly expanded free availability, Rider’s popularity among students and OSS developers is poised to grow. Still, it remains somewhat niche compared to Visual Studio’s long-entrenched user base, but it’s a niche with very high satisfaction and specific advantages (speed, cross-platform consistency, built-in Resharper features).

## VS Code – A Lightweight Option, Widely Used in General but Smaller in .NET Circles

**VS Code** – Microsoft’s open-source, lightweight code editor, is enormously popular in the general programming world. However, when focusing on .NET developers specifically, VS Code plays a more limited role as an IDE substitute. Many .NET devs use VS Code for certain tasks or quick edits, but fewer use it as their primary environment compared to full IDEs.

* **Global Popularity vs. .NET Usage:** The contrast is striking, **VS Code is the #1 development tool overall**, used by almost three-quarters of developers worldwide. The Stack Overflow 2023 survey showed \~74% of all respondents use VS Code regularly, and in 2024 it was around 73–74% as well. In those same surveys, VS Code far outranked traditional IDEs among the broad developer community. **However, among .NET-focused developers, VS Code is less dominant**. JetBrains’ 2023 data shows **14% of C# developers primarily use VS Code** as their editor, a significant share, but well behind Visual Studio and Rider in this niche. Similarly, the Uno Platform survey noted VS Code as the solid #2 IDE for their Microsoft-centric audience, but it was still “firmly” behind Visual Studio in usage.

* **Role of VS Code in .NET dev workflows:** Those .NET developers who do use VS Code often do so for specific reasons: it’s **lightweight and cross-platform**, making it useful for quickly editing .NET scripts, doing cloud/web development, or working on simpler .NET Core projects where a heavy IDE isn’t necessary. On macOS and Linux, some .NET devs who didn’t use Rider have historically turned to VS Code (especially when VS for Mac was lacking). That said, JetBrains noted that **much of VS Code’s usage in the .NET context comes “from the C# plugins and .NET tools”** available for it. In other words, VS Code by itself is a general editor, but .NET devs rely on extensions like the C# (OmniSharp) plugin, .NET CLI integration, debugger, etc., to make it a capable C# development environment. With these extensions, VS Code can offer debugging, IntelliSense, and project support for .NET, albeit not as fully integrated as VS or Rider. Many .NET devs also use VS Code as a supplemental tool, for example, editing front-end files (Angular/React) in an ASP.NET Core project, or viewing code on a remote server, while keeping Visual Studio/Rider for the core C# work.

* **Adoption by different segments:** VS Code is completely free and open source, which makes it popular among students and new developers generally. In Stack Overflow’s survey, those “learning to code” actually use VS Code at an even higher rate (78%+). We can infer that many *beginner .NET* learners might start with VS Code for simple console apps or Unity scripts before possibly moving to an IDE. However, once projects grow, many .NET devs gravitate to VS or Rider for the richer tooling. Still, VS Code remains a common secondary tool in .NET workflows and is beloved for its speed and huge extension ecosystem. It’s also the go-to editor for scenarios like editing .NET code on a Mac without needing a heavy IDE, or doing .NET Core development in containers/WSL on Windows. Microsoft has positioned VS Code as the editor for cross-platform .NET development and even recommended it as a replacement when Visual Studio for Mac was ended (though not all were convinced. One Redditor called the idea that “VS Code will substitute VS for Mac” *“delusional”*, underscoring that many Mac users instead moved to Rider for a full IDE experience).

Overall, **VS Code’s share among dedicated .NET developers is on the order of 10–15%** as primary tool, which is lower than its usage among developers at large. It’s valued for its light footprint and versatility, but for large .NET solutions the full IDEs still rule. We should note, however, that **VS Code is continually improving for .NET** (e.g., with extensions like IntelliCode, and even a new C# Dev Kit extension from Microsoft). If more IDE-like features keep coming, some developers indicate they would use VS Code more. The Uno survey found that a portion of Visual Studio users would be willing to switch to VS Code as their only IDE *“if it had some additional IDE-like features”*. This suggests VS Code has latent appeal even among .NET devs, should it bridge certain gaps. For now, it remains the third-choice environment for most .NET programmers, after Visual Studio and Rider.

## Other Tools and Notable Mentions

Outside the big three, a few other environments deserve mention:

* **Visual Studio for Mac:** As discussed, this was Microsoft’s official IDE on macOS, but it struggled with performance and features. Its usage was always a small fraction (JetBrains found \~2% in 2021) and by 2023 it likely dwindled further. Microsoft’s decision to retire VS for Mac (announced in mid-2023) acknowledges that most Mac-based .NET developers had already opted for other tools. With its discontinuation, nearly all serious macOS .NET developers use either Rider or VS Code now. This has solidified Rider’s position on Mac.

* **Legacy and Niche Editors:** A small number of .NET developers use other editors like **Notepad++, Vim/Emacs, Sublime Text, or other niche IDEs**. These typically register only a percent or two in surveys. For example, JetBrains noted \~1% answered “Other” for their primary C# editor in 2023 – presumably the hardcore users of plain text editors or less common IDEs. In Stack Overflow’s general survey, Notepad++ (which is Windows-only) actually appears quite high globally (around 24% of devs use it for some tasks), but for .NET development specifically it’s rarely the main tool (it might be used in conjunction with VS for quick file edits). Essentially, nearly all .NET developers are on VS, Rider, or VS Code, with only a fringe using something else as their main environment.

* **Azure Cloud/Dev Containers:** While not an “IDE” per se, it’s worth noting some .NET developers are experimenting with cloud-based dev environments (GitHub Codespaces, VS Code in the browser, etc.) especially for open-source projects or onboarding. These typically still use VS Code as the editor front-end. No survey yet shows a large shift to cloud IDEs in .NET, but it’s a trend to watch beyond 2025.

* **IDE Plugins and Extensions:** .NET developers are heavy users of IDE extensions. We already mentioned 32% of Visual Studio users install ReSharper. GitHub Copilot (AI coding assistant) is another example: in JetBrains’ 2023 results, **25% of C# developers using VS Code had the GitHub Copilot extension enabled**. Copilot and IntelliCode are also popular in Visual Studio. This shows .NET devs, like many others, are enhancing their environments with AI and plugins, regardless of IDE choice. (While tangential to “which IDE,” this underscores that raw IDE adoption stats don’t tell the full story of tool usage within .NET development.)

The table below summarizes the approximate usage shares of the major IDEs/editors among .NET developers, based on the JetBrains 2023 survey and other cited data:

| Primary IDE/Editor for .NET Devs        | Approx. Usage Share of .NET Developers (2023)             |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Visual Studio (Windows)**             | **\~50–55%** (majority) – #1 overall.                     |
| **Rider (Win/Mac/Linux)**               | **32%** of .NET devs – #2 overall.                        |
| **VS Code (Win/Mac/Linux)**             | **14%** of .NET devs – #3 overall.                        |
| Visual Studio for Mac (now retired)     | \~1–2% (was small; users largely migrated to Rider).      |
| Other editors (Notepad++, Vim, etc.)    | \~1% (very few use an unlisted editor as primary).        |

*(Sources: JetBrains Developer Ecosystem 2023 C# survey; JetBrains .NET 2021 report for historical VS Mac figure. Visual Studio’s share is by difference, since JetBrains notes it remains the most popular IDE with the balance of users not on Rider/VSCode.)*

As a sanity check, these .NET-specific figures differ markedly from general programmer stats. For example, across all developers globally, VS Code is \~70–75% while Visual Studio is \~28–30%, but in the .NET world Visual Studio leads and VS Code is a minority choice. Rider, which has \~5% overall usage, jumps to \~30% in the .NET niche. This highlights that **preferences of .NET developers are somewhat distinct from the wider ecosystem**, likely due to the specialized needs of C#/.NET (which benefit from full-featured IDEs and historically were tied to Windows).

# Conclusion and Outlook

**In summary, Visual Studio on Windows remains the powerhouse IDE for .NET development, but JetBrains Rider and VS Code have firmly established themselves in significant niches of the .NET ecosystem.** Surveys in 2023 show most .NET developers use Visual Studio (often enhanced with plugins) as their primary IDE, especially in professional settings and on Windows machines. At the same time, about one-third have adopted JetBrains Rider – particularly those on macOS or Linux, and those in fields like game development or cross-platform enterprise work, where Rider’s performance and cross-OS support shine. A smaller but notable segment (\~1 in 7) use VS Code as their main editor for .NET, mostly for its lightweight flexibility or when a full IDE is less available, though many more use VS Code as a supplemental tool rather than the primary one.

Across **professionals, hobbyists, students, and open-source contributors**, these trends generally hold but with some differences in tool choice motivations. Professionals often have access to paid tools (Visual Studio Enterprise or Rider licenses) and large projects that benefit from powerful IDE features, hence Visual Studio and Rider are popular in industry. Hobbyists and students, who gravitate to free tools, have historically leaned toward Visual Studio Community or VS Code – but with Rider now free for non-commercial use, we may see more young and hobby developers embrace Rider as well. Open-source .NET maintainers similarly have new incentives to use Rider (free OSS licenses) or VS Code, though many still use Visual Studio if their projects are Windows-focused. It’s worth noting that all three major tools (VS, Rider, VS Code) are available at no cost to non-commercial developers now – Visual Studio Community is free, Rider is free for non-commercial as of 2024, and VS Code is always free. This means **choice of IDE in the .NET world is less constrained by price and more by preference and platform**.

Finally, the data suggests .NET developers are quite up-to-date in their toolchains. JetBrains found that many C# developers quickly adopt the latest IDE versions and language versions. For instance, a Microsoft MVP noted it’s *“great that more and more developers are staying up to date with the latest versions of their IDE”* – Visual Studio 2022 saw rapid uptake. The .NET ecosystem’s modern, cross-platform direction (with .NET 6/7/8) has broadened the range of tools and OSes devs use, but also keeps a large contingent on Windows with Visual Studio. We can expect Visual Studio to remain dominant in enterprise .NET development, while Rider’s cross-platform appeal grows in niche areas and VS Code continues to serve as a versatile editor in the .NET toolbox.

**Key takeaways:** Visual Studio on Windows is used by the majority of .NET developers (benefiting from familiarity and extensive features). JetBrains Rider, with roughly one-third adoption, is the second-most popular IDE and the primary choice on macOS (and increasingly on Linux) for .NET devs. VS Code, though the top editor generally, is used as the main environment by a smaller segment of .NET developers (\~10–15%) – it’s common for web/cloud-focused .NET work or as a secondary tool. Surveys from LinkedIn/Twitter and Reddit echo these patterns, with community sentiment acknowledging Visual Studio’s large lead but also Rider’s performance and cross-OS advantages and VS Code’s ubiquity as a coder’s editor. The period 2023–2025 has seen Microsoft’s Visual Studio family consolidate (dropping the Mac version) and JetBrains making a play for wider Rider adoption (freeing it up for non-commercial use), so the competition remains vibrant. **For .NET developers of all stripes – professional, student, or hobbyist – there is now a rich choice of IDEs on every operating system, and usage is split roughly into a majority on Visual Studio and a significant minority on Rider, with VS Code filling in many of the remaining use cases.** Each of these tools has a strong community and support, ensuring that .NET developers can be productive on the platform of their choice.

**Sources:** Surveys by JetBrains (2023), Stack Overflow (2023–24), Uno Platform (2022), Dave Callan’s poll (2023), and community discussions.
